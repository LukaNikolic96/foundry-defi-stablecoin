This is pegged or anchored stablecoin to the US dollar -> $1.00
Minting or stability mechanism will be Algorithmic (Decentralized) - no sigle entity will control it
It will be exogenous - we will use outside value (crypto ETH & BTC) as collateral

It will use Chainlink price feed and a function to exchange ETH & BTC for their dollar ($) equivalent.
That way we will make it stable.
We will also code that people can only mint stablecoin when there is enough collateral.
We will use only wrapped wETH & wBTC as deposit.
